This is a tool I made to stay organized in my day job as a part-time announcer at a local NPR station!

However, this code is a little cumbersome to use - to use Fills mode, you have to copy every single fill from the log manually.

Therefore, I don't expect that anyone besides me will find this script useful. 

It was fun to make, though!

## Features
- Lists every fill and optionally sorts them by the short ones first
- Keeps track of which ones have been finished
- Lists each promo yet to be done, displays the time the show airs, and launches the corresponding URL
- Launches the weather.gov site for your area
- Copies each cut number to the clipboard so you can paste it right into Audacity!
- New approach to a terminal-based UI I want to expand on in future projects!
