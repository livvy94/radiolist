This is a tool I made to stay organized in my day job as a part-time announcer at a local NPR station!

However, this code is a little cumbersome to use - to use Fills mode, you have to copy every single fill from the log manually, which is cumbersome.

Therefore, I don't expect that anyone besides me will find this script useful. 

It was fun to make, though!
